# Project Definition  

*Author: Sebastian Veuskens* 

*Project definition approach was inspired by [cowinkiedink](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/mumrgn/how_to_plan_and_build_a_programming_project_a/)*

*A guideline for project workflow using github projects is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects) along [best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/best-practices-for-projects) on how to leverage them.* 

## 1. What is the project? 

A platform that demonstrates at least one AI approach to try to find a successful strategy in the popular game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) for a given starting position. A visual display of the game board will display the starting position as well as the move decisions of the AI in a step-by-step manner. Different board sizes and number of boats can be selected to account for complexity. 

## 2. What is the MVP? 

The minimal viable product is a simple AI that is able to play a game in accordance with the rules and performs better than random guessing. A (non-interactive) local visual display of the game and its steps has to be implemented. 

## 3. What are the nice2haves? 

- Compare more than one AI approach to each other. Especially a reinforcement learning algorithm in comparison with a bayes/naive approach would be interesting. 

- Having a visual platform on a website instead of a local machine.

- Render the display of the board to make it look more appealing. 

- An interactive platform that lets people chose the size of the board, number of boats, the algorithm and when to go to the next step. 

- A fully-responsive platform that lets users play games against the AI. 
    - For this feature, more definitions for the AI have to be made about the choice of starting position as well as the opponents gameplay as an additional input. 

## 4. When will the project be complete? 

When a visually appealing platform for the game is available that allows the demonstrations of the algorithms.
